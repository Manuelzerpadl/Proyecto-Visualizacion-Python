# Project Description

A very efficient way to better understand the data we are working with is to visualize it, in this project we will focus on giving color and shape to the information we have been working with during the last week, mainly focused on Spain.

# Objective

understand the problem of suicides by different generations, gender and if the gdp influences the number of suicides per 100,000 inhabitants.

## Suicides per age

We can observe through this bar chart that the age range where most suicides accumulate from 1990 to 2017 is 75 years and older.

## Suicides per generation & genre

Here we can see how the highest number of suicides is concentrated in Silent Generation & G.I Generation, which coincides with our previous data as they are the oldest generations in our study.

## Relationship between gdp and suicide rate

Higher gdp growth influences decrease in suicide rate

## Number of suicides by gender since 1990

We can see how historically the number of suicides in women has remained the same with very small variations, however, despite the fact that suicides have declined due to the increase in the gdp, the number of suicides in men has continued to increase.
